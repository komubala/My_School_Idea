Idea for my school where I will be chief administrator.

A school in a rural area which allows a student to explore a variety of subjects: science, maths, history, geography, economics or 
commercial education including practical and mathematical training, music or other fine arts, physical sports, 
workshop abilities (carpentry, plumbing, etc.), agriculture/horticulture.
Whatever the topic they choose, they have to train themselves to excel in it without any lackadaisical attitude. 

They will initially receive opportunity to try out everything. Also there will be regular open days in each department 
where they will be encouraged to get exposure to the different projects being pursued and an exposure to the state-of-the-art in 
that field. Once they choose a topic, they have to work on honing their skills to become the best in what they choose. But also keeping 
an eye out to see what happens in other fields to see if any interesting and novel connections can be made.

I want to run this school such that it evens out any deficiencies that a student from a rural and improverished background may suffer.
So I prefere to have minimal fees if there has to be any fees at all, and will essentially be a token amount recieved to reserve a seat 
in the school. For any class over the kindergarten, there will be entrance tests to join the school. However, it will not be that the student 
cannot join below a score. But it will decide in what class the student can join irrespective of age or what he has passed prior to this test.

Skills that need to be definitely inculcated in addition to specialising in a chosen field:
Basic life skills such as (1) basic mathematical ability, (2) to read, write and speak in at least 3 languages (one necessarily English),
(3) logic and basic scientific knowledge, (4) moral, ethical and cultural education, (5) environmental awareness, (6) physical training,
(7) basic history of India and social awareness, (8) basic legal education and constitution of India, and (9) lessons on the glory of 
Indian scientific, political and cultural history. 
An exposure to cultures of the west and east will help in taking the good from others, and also help in seeing the good in ours more clearly.

This requires:
1. Exceptional teachers in each of these subjects who are interested at a research level in their topic of interest 
and also pedagogically oriented. They should have natural inclination to learn, upgrade and adapt themselves constantly.

2. Infrastructure that supports any research vetted by a panel of subject experts from outside the school
(within a "reasonable" fund limit) that either the faculty or student wishes to carry out should be fully supported.
In the case of fine arts, mechanical workshop or sport, any project again vetted as viable by a panel of external subject experts
(of comparable expense to the scientific research) should be supported. These external experts can be suggested by the faculty/student
but will be selected by a panel nominated by the chief administrator. Any project deemed unsafe or unethical can be vetoed by the 
chief administrator, and therefore has to be submitted for assessment to the chief administrator before it goes out to subject experts.

3. Professionals in each field should be invited on a regular basis to train the faculty and have regular interaction with students.
Their visits should be funded. Also, selected students and faculty (selected on merit basis) should have opportunity to participate in 
industrial exposure/conference/workshops and events like thygaraya utsavam for music, etc.

4. School environement and teachers who appreciate the importance of "getting" the correct questions (rather than the correct answers).
For instance, history should be not only about when what happened, but what effect an event in a country had world-over. What would have 
happened if such an event did not happen.
For instance, in science, the importance of dimensional analysis in actual physical modelling of an experiment from scratch instead of 
just teaching a law. Making the student arrive at the law without feeding it to him/her.

5. Techers who are willing to work 8-8 (12 hours at least), and who sincerely appreciate the weight of responsibility on them. 
Their responsibility of not only the future of the students but also the future of this nation.
I will personally oversee their appointment especially a round of interview that tests their tenacity of purpose, and their 
willingness to put in their soul towards teaching.

6. Teachers cannot be personally related to any of their students. I realise well that a teacher is always fair and will never bring 
emotions to their work. But when we are in a position of power, it is best to avoid the least bit of controversy that will lend the slightest 
edge to unnecessary talk. A teacher should lead by exmaple, and as a teacher myself, I want to personally ensure that their fairness shall 
never come into question anywhere. Also, teachers working in my school when they sit in recruitment panels should declare and excuse themselves 
if one of the candidates is related to them in any manner, or if they have any prior association with them. Also, if they are related to anyone 
personally in the existing faculty, it should be reported and clearly documented. Related persons can't be in a reporting structure.

7. Teachers should be willing to show the videos of other teachers who explain the concept better to students. They need to realise that each 
class is a learning experience for them too. To avoid monotony, they cannot teach the same standard (same set of lessons) 
for more than two consecutive years.

8. Parents who appreciate, understand and support a sincere teacher in his/her efforts to discipline their charge. 
Yearly parent-teacher meetings (in the absence of students) emphasizing 
(a) how the teachers play a pivotal role in shaping a child's future, and 
(b) how advising their inaction when the child requires correction is detrimental to the child's well-being. 
Also, at the same time, having regular PRIVATE sessions with the teachers to emphasize fair behaviour is also important 
for correct administration. However, it is imperative that it is a private session with the teacher as the student's respect for 
the teacher should never be shaken even by the slightest amount as it is very important for the student to grow. NOT for the teacher.
